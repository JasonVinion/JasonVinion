# Hello! I'm Jason Vinion

### About Me 🌍

I'm currently a student with aspirations of furthering my education in the Netherlands. I'm thrilled to share that I've been conditionally accepted into a university there. My aim is to delve into academia, with a keen interest in psychology. However, I also find computer science intriguing and remain open to various research fields.

In my downtime:

- 📚 I enjoy reading, with Exurb1a being a particular favorite author of mine.
- 🎧 I listen to EDM and Techno Classical music.
- 🐱 I have a cat and a dog that keep me company.
- 🚗 I'm an advocate for reducing car dependency, believing in the benefits of sustainable transportation.

### My Vision 🌟

My long-term goal is to contribute as a full-time researcher, adding to our collective knowledge and hopefully positively impacting my chosen field.
